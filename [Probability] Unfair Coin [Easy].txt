/*
There is a fair coin (one side heads, one side tails) and an unfair coin (both sides tails). You pick one at random, flip it 5 times, and observe that it comes up as tails all five times. What is the chance that you are flipping the unfair coin?
*/

I think it's easier to calculate the chance that you picked the fair coin and that it lands five tails in a row:
	1 / 2 ^ 6 = 1.5625â€¬%, so you have 98.4375% of having the unfair coin.
